# What we do in the shadows (of devops)
A demo repository that demonstrates how to automate both your software defined infrastructure/services and application deployments

Teams that create/manage the automation of Software Defined Infrastructure and Application Deployments go by many names:
- Site Reliability Engineers
- Cloud Platform Engineers/Developers
- DevOps Engineers

A rose by any other name, is still automated shell scripts.  Often tasks done in the shadows of most organizations.

We'll attempt to compose some baseline considerations/samples as a starting point for your software defined environment. We will also curate a number of optional labs that build upon the baseline environment.
